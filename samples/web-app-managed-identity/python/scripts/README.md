# Azure CLI Deployment

This directory includes Bash scripts designed for deploying and testing the sample Web App utilizing the `azlocal` CLI. Refer to the [Azure Web App with Managed Identity](../README.md) guide for details about the sample application.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this solution, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [LocalStack for Azure](https://azure.localstack.cloud/): Local Azure cloud emulator for development and testing
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Code editor installed on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Container runtime required for LocalStack
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli): Azure command-line interface
- [Azlocal CLI](https://azure.localstack.cloud/user-guides/sdks/az/): LocalStack Azure CLI wrapper
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python runtime (version 3.12 or above)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/): JSON processor for scripting and parsing command outputs

### Installing azlocal CLI

The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) Bash script uses the `azlocal` CLI to work with LocalStack. Install it using:

```bash
pip install azlocal
```

For more information, see [Get started with the az tool on LocalStack](https://azure.localstack.cloud/user-guides/sdks/az/).

## Architecture Overview

The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) Bash script creates the following Azure resources using Azure CLI commands:

1. [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview): Provides blob storage for persisting vacation activity data. The web application stores each activity as a JSON blob file in the `activities` container.
2. [Azure App Service Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans): Defines the compute resources (CPU, memory, and scaling options) that host the web application.
3. [Azure Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview): Hosts the Python Flask-based *Vacation Planner* application. The web app uses managed identity to securely access the Azure Storage Account without requiring explicit credentials.
4. [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview): Provides secure, credential-free authentication between the web app and storage account. Supports both system-assigned and user-assigned identity types.
5. [Role Assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments): Grants the web app's managed identity the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role, enabling read/write access to blob containers.
6. [App Service Source Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/create-or-update-source-control?view=rest-appservice-2024-11-01): (Optional) Enables continuous deployment from a Git repository for automated application updates.

The web app allows users to plan and manage vacation activities, storing all activity data as blob files in the `activities` containers in the [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview). For more information, see [Azure Web App with Managed Identity](../README.md).

## Provisioning Scripts 

## Automation Scripts

This sample provides two bash scripts to streamline the deployment process by automating the provisioning of Azure resources and the sample application:

- [user-assigned.sh](user-assigned.sh): Configures the Azure Web App with a *user-assigned managed identity*
- [system-assigned.sh](system-assigned.sh): Configures the Azure Web App with a *system-assigned managed identity*

See the script files for complete implementation. The scripts perform the following operations:

- Detect environment (LocalStack or Azure Cloud) and select appropriate CLI
- Create resource group if it doesn't exist
- Provision storage account and retrieve access keys and endpoints
- Create blob container for activity data
- Create App Service Plan with Linux runtime
- Create user-assigned managed identity (user-assigned script only)
- Retrieve identity client ID, principal ID, and resource ID
- Create web app with specified Python runtime
- Assign managed identity to web app
- Configure Storage Blob Data Contributor role assignment with retry logic
- Set web app configuration settings (storage URL, container name, client ID)
- Package application code into zip file
- Deploy zip package to Azure Web App
- Clean up temporary artifacts

These scripts eliminate manual configuration steps and enable one-command deployment of the entire infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `azlocal` CLI as a drop-in replacement for the `az` CLI to direct all commands to the LocalStack for Azure emulator. Alternatively, run `azlocal start-interception` to automatically intercept and redirect all `az` commands to LocalStack. To revert back to the default behavior and send commands to the Azure cloud, run `azlocal stop-interception`.

## Deployment

You can set up the Azure emulator by utilizing LocalStack for Azure Docker image. Before starting, ensure you have a valid `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to access the Azure emulator. Refer to the [Auth Token guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/?__hstc=108988063.8aad2b1a7229945859f4d9b9bb71e05d.1743148429561.1758793541854.1758810151462.32&__hssc=108988063.3.1758810151462&__hsfp=3945774529) to obtain your Auth Token and specify it in the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. The Azure Docker image is available on the [LocalStack Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack-azure-alpha). To pull the Azure Docker image, execute the following command:

```bash
docker pull localstack/localstack-azure-alpha
```

Start the LocalStack Azure emulator using the localstack CLI, execute the following command:

```bash
# Set the authentication token
export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>

# Start the LocalStack Azure emulator
IMAGE_NAME=localstack/localstack-azure-alpha localstack start -d
localstack wait -t 60

# Route all Azure CLI calls to the LocalStack Azure emulator
azlocal start-interception
```

Navigate to the `scripts` folder:

```bash
cd samples/web-app-managed-identity/python/scripts
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

Run the deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Validation

After deployment, you can use the `validate.sh` script to verify that all resources were created and configured correctly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
# Check resource group
az group show \
--name local-rg \
--output table

# List resources
az resource list \
--resource-group local-rg \
--output table

# Check Azure Web App
az webapp show \
--name local-webapp-test \
--resource-group local-rg \
--output table

# Check storage account properties
az storage account show \
  --name localstoragetest \
  --resource-group local-rg \
  --output table

# List storage containers
az storage container list \
  --account-name localstoragetest \
  --output table \
  --only-show-errors
```

## Cleanup

To destroy all created resources:

```bash
# Delete resource group and all contained resources
az group delete --name local-rg --yes --no-wait

# Verify deletion
az group list --output table
```

This will remove all Azure resources created by the CLI deployment script.
