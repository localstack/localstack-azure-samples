# Terraform Deployment

This directory contains Terraform modules and a deployment script for provisioning Azure services in LocalStack for Azure. Refer to the [Azure Functions App with Managed Identity](../README.md) guide for details about the sample application.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this solution, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [LocalStack for Azure](https://azure.localstack.cloud/): Local Azure cloud emulator for development and testing
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Code editor installed on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads): Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning Azure resources
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python runtime (version 3.13 or above)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Container runtime required for LocalStack
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli): Azure command-line interface
- [azlocal CLI](https://azure.localstack.cloud/user-guides/sdks/az/): LocalStack Azure CLI wrapper
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/): JSON processor for scripting and parsing command outputs

### Installing azlocal CLI

The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) Bash script uses the `azlocal` CLI instead of the standard Azure CLI to work with LocalStack. Install it using:

```bash
pip install azlocal
```

For more information, see [Get started with the az tool on LocalStack](https://azure.localstack.cloud/user-guides/sdks/az/).

## Architecture Overview

The [main.tf](main.tf) Terraform module creates the following Azure resources:

1. [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview): Provides blob storage with `input` and `output` containers for storing text blobs processed by the function app.
2. [Azure App Service Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans): Defines the compute resources (CPU, memory, and scaling options) that host the Azure Functions app.
3. [Azure Functions App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview): Hosts the serverless application that processes text blobs. The function app uses managed identity to securely access the Azure Storage Account without requiring explicit credentials.
4. [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview): Provides secure, credential-free authentication between the Azure Functions app and storage account. Supports both system-assigned and user-assigned identity types.
5. [Role Assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments): Grants the Azure Functions app's managed identity the Storage Blob Data Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles, enabling read/write access to blob containers and queues for processing text data.

For more information on the sample application, see [Azure Functions App with Managed Identity](../README.md).

## Provisioning Scripts

The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) script automates the deployment of all Azure resources and the sample application in a single step. Before running the script, customize the variable values based on your needs. In particular, use the `MANAGED_IDENTITY_TYPE` variable to specify the type of managed identity to provision: `SystemAssigned` or `UserAssigned`.

> **Note**  
> You can use the `azlocal` CLI as a drop-in replacement for the `az` CLI to direct all commands to the LocalStack for Azure emulator. Alternatively, run `azlocal start-interception` to automatically intercept and redirect all `az` commands to LocalStack. Likewise, the `tflocal` is a local replacement for the standard `terraform` CLI, allowing you to run Terraform commands against LocalStack's Azure emulation environment. For more information, see [Get started with the az tool on LocalStack](https://azure.localstack.cloud/user-guides/sdks/az/).

The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) script executes the following steps:

- Cleans up any previous Terraform state and plan files to ensure a fresh deployment
- Initializes the Terraform working directory and downloads required plugins
- Creates and validates a Terraform execution plan for the Azure infrastructure
- Applies the Terraform plan to provision all necessary Azure resources
- Extracts resource names and outputs from the Terraform deployment
- Packages the code of the serverless application into a zip file for deployment
- Deploys the zip package to the Azure Functions App using the LocalStack Azure CLI

## Configuration

When using LocalStack for Azure, configure the `metadata_host` and `subscription_id` settings in the [Azure Provider for Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) to ensure proper connectivity:


```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {
    resource_group {
      prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false
    }
  }

  # Set the hostname of the Azure Metadata Service (for example management.azure.com) 
  # used to obtain the Cloud Environment when using LocalStack's Azure emulator. 
  # This allows the provider to correctly identify the environment and avoid making calls to the real Azure endpoints. 
  metadata_host="localhost.localstack.cloud:4566"

  # Set the subscription ID to a dummy value when using LocalStack's Azure emulator.
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

## Deployment

You can set up the Azure emulator by utilizing LocalStack for Azure Docker image. Before starting, ensure you have a valid `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to access the Azure emulator. Refer to the [Auth Token guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/?__hstc=108988063.8aad2b1a7229945859f4d9b9bb71e05d.1743148429561.1758793541854.1758810151462.32&__hssc=108988063.3.1758810151462&__hsfp=3945774529) to obtain your Auth Token and specify it in the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. The Azure Docker image is available on the [LocalStack Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack-azure-alpha). To pull the Azure Docker image, execute the following command:

```bash
docker pull localstack/localstack-azure-alpha
```

Start the LocalStack Azure emulator using the localstack CLI, execute the following command:

```bash
# Set the authentication token
export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>

# Start the LocalStack Azure emulator
IMAGE_NAME=localstack/localstack-azure-alpha localstack start -d
localstack wait -t 60

# Route all Azure CLI calls to the LocalStack Azure emulator
azlocal start-interception
```

Navigate to the `terraform` folder:

```bash
cd samples/function-app-managed-identity/python/terraform
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

Run the deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Validation

After deployment, you can use the `validate.sh` script to verify that all resources were created and configured correctly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
# Check resource group
az group show \
  --name local-rg \
  --output table

# List resources
az resource list \
  --resource-group local-rg \
  --output table

# Check function app status
az functionapp show  \
  --name local-func-test \
  --resource-group local-rg \
  --output table

# Check storage account properties
az storage account show \
  --name localstoragetest \
  --resource-group local-rg \
  --output table

# List storage containers
az storage container list \
  --account-name localstoragetest \
  --output table \
  --only-show-errors
```

## Cleanup

To destroy all created resources:

```bash
# Delete resource group and all contained resources
az group delete --name local-rg --yes --no-wait

# Verify deletion
az group list --output table
```

This will remove all Azure resources created by the CLI deployment script.
