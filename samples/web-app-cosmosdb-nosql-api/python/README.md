# Azure Web App with Azure CosmosDB for NoSQL API

This sample demonstrates a Python Flask single-page web application called *Vacation Planner* hosted on an [Azure Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview). The app runs on an Azure App Service Plan and stores activity data in the `activities` container of the `sampledb` NoSQL database on an [Azure CosmosDB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-nosql) account.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the solution:

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)

- **Azure Web App**: Hosts the Python Flask application
- **Azure App Service Plan**: Provides compute resources for the web app
- **Azure CosmosDB for NoSQL API**: Stores activity data in a CosmosDB container

## Prerequisites

- [lstk CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/developer-tools/running-localstack/lstk/)
- [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Macs with Apple silicon**: this sample deploys a web app from code. The emulator builds it with Microsoft's Oryx build image and runs it on an Oryx runtime image, and Microsoft publishes both for amd64 only ([microsoft/Oryx#2133](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/issues/2133) asks for arm64).
> On a Mac with Apple silicon they run only under Docker Desktop's amd64 emulation: in Docker Desktop's settings, under **General**, select the **Apple Virtualization framework** as the Virtual Machine Manager and turn on **Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon**.
> Under QEMU, which Docker Desktop uses otherwise (Rosetta off, or Docker VMM, which has no Rosetta), the sample is not expected to work: Oryx is a .NET app, and [.NET does not support QEMU](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/supported-os.md).
> The sample does not run on an arm64 Linux host without amd64 emulation.

## Deployment

Set up the Azure emulator using the LocalStack for Azure Docker image. Before starting, ensure you have a valid `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to access the Azure emulator. Refer to the [Auth Token guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/) to obtain your Auth Token and set it in the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. The Azure Docker image is available on the [LocalStack Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack-azure). To pull the image, execute:

```bash
docker pull localstack/localstack-azure
```

Start the LocalStack Azure emulator by running:

```bash
# Set the authentication token
export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>

# Start the LocalStack Azure emulator
lstk start --type azure

# Route all Azure CLI calls to the LocalStack Azure emulator
lstk az start-interception
```

Deploy the application to LocalStack for Azure using:

- [Azure CLI Deployment](./scripts/README.md)

> [!NOTE]
> When you deploy the application to LocalStack for Azure for the first time, the initialization process involves downloading and building Docker images. This is a one-time operation—subsequent deployments will be significantly faster. Depending on your internet connection and system resources, this initial setup may take several minutes.

## Test

1. Retrieve the host port Docker maps to the port the Web App listens on in its container, for example with `docker port <container-name>` (the container's name starts with `ls-<web-app-name>`). Do not assume port 80: the app listens on the port its `WEBSITES_PORT` app setting names, when it has one.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<published-port>`.
3. If the deployment was successful, you will see the following user interface for adding and removing activities:

You can use the `call-web-app.sh` Bash script below to call the web app. The script demonstrates three methods for calling web apps:

1. **Through the LocalStack for Azure emulator**: Call the web app via the emulator using its default host name. The emulator acts as a proxy to the web app.
2. **Via localhost and host port mapped to the container's port**: Use `127.0.0.1` with the host port mapped to the container's port `80`.
3. **Via container IP address**: Use the app container's IP address on port `80`. This technique is only available when accessing the web app from the Docker host machine.
4. **Via the default hostname**: Call the web app via the default hostname `<web-app-name>.azurewebsites.azure.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566`.

## CosmosDB Tooling

You can utilize **CosmosDB Data Explorer** to explore and manage your CosmosDB databases and containers. Ensure you connect using `http://localhost:port` connection string, where `port` corresponds to the port published by the CosmosDB container on the host and mapped to the internal CosmosDB port `1234`.
